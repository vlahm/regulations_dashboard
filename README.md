# Regulations Dashboard

### A scientist-friendly interface to public policy

The following scripts retrieve and maintain a list of documents in the Federal Register that are currently open for comment. This forms the back-end of a website (coming soon) for streamlining the process of public comment by scientists, as a way to increase efficacy of research and expand outreach.

03_functions.R retrieves new records using the Federal Register API   
04_update_records.R creates a Google Sheet of current records and generates transfer files of records that need to be deleted or appended.  
05_delete_rows.py deletes obsolete rows from the Google Sheet using the Python interface to the Sheets API, due to limitations in the googlesheets package for R.  
06_add_rows.R then appends new rows, relayed in a temporary transfer file.  
These files are intended to be run in sequence by a task scheduler.  
dash_lastRun, client_secret.json, and fedRegOut.csv are all generated by the other scripts, and do not need to be managed.
