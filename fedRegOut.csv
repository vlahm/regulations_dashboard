This change would require shippers of apples and grapes exported from the United States to electronically enter an Export Form Certificate number or a USDA-defined exemption code into the Automated Export System (AES). This rule would also define ``shipper,'' shift the current file retention requirement from carriers to shippers, and require shippers to provide, upon request, copies of the certificates to the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). These changes would enable AMS to track exported apple and grape shipments to ensure that exports meet inspection and certification requirements. This action is also required to support the International Trade Data System (ITDS), a key White House economic initiative that will automate the filing of export and import information by the trade. This proposal would also remove obsolete regulations and make clarifying changes. It also announces AMS' intention to request revision to a currently approved information collection for exported apples and grapes."

Based on its regular interaction with stakeholders, TSA assumes many higher-risk railroads (freight and passenger), public transportation agencies, and over-the- road buses (OTRBs) have implemented security programs with security measures similar to those identified by the 9/11 Act's regulatory requirements. In general, TSA is requesting information on three types of issues. First, existing practices, standards, tools, or other resources used or available for conducting vulnerability assessments and developing security plans. Second, information on existing security measures, including whether implemented voluntarily or in response to other regulatory requirements, and the potential impact of additional requirements on operations. Third, information on the scope/cost of current security systems and other measures used to provide security and mitigate vulnerabilities. This information is necessary for TSA to establish the current baseline, estimate cost of implementing the statutory mandate, and develop appropriate performance standards. While TSA will review and consider all comments submitted, TSA invites responses to a number of specific questions posed in the ANPRM. See the Comments Invited section under SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION that follows."

Adding these facilities would meaningfully increase the information available to the public on releases and other waste management of listed chemicals from the natural gas processing sector and further the purposes of EPCRA section 313. EPA estimates that at least 282 NGP facilities in the U.S. would meet the TRI employee threshold (10 full- time employees or equivalent) and manufacture, process, or otherwise use (threshold activities) at least one TRI-listed chemical in excess of applicable threshold quantities. NGP facilities in the U.S. manufacture, process, or otherwise use more than 21 different TRI- listed chemicals, including n-hexane, hydrogen sulfide, toluene, benzene, xylene, and methanol.

The primary intent of the deductible concept is to incentivize greater State resilience to future disasters, thereby reducing future disaster costs nationally. On January 20, 2016, FEMA (the Agency) published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) seeking comment on a Public Assistance deductible concept. The ANPRM provided a general description of the concept that many commenters found insufficient to provide meaningful comment. In an effort to offer the public a more detailed deductible concept upon which to provide additional feedback, the Agency is issuing a supplemental ANPRM (SANPRM) that presents a conceptual deductible program, including a methodology for calculating deductible amounts based on a combination of each State's fiscal capacity and disaster risk, a proposed credit structure to reward States for undertaking resilience-building activities, and a description of how FEMA could consider implementing the program. At this stage of the rulemaking process, the deductible remains only something that FEMA is considering. The policy conceived of in this document is not a proposal. In this document, FEMA is providing what is merely a description of a direction FEMA could take in future rulemaking in an effort to solicit further feedback from the public. After considering the comments it receives, or as a result of other factors, FEMA may expand on or redevelop this concept."

This will create an information environment in which vehicle and device manufacturers can create and implement applications to improve safety, mobility, and the environment. Without a mandate to require and standardize V2V communications, the agency believes that manufacturers will not be able to move forward in an efficient way and that a critical mass of equipped vehicles would take many years to develop, if ever. Implementation of the new standard will enable vehicle manufacturers to develop safety applications that employ V2V communications as an input, two of which are estimated to prevent hundreds of thousands of crashes and prevent over one thousand fatalities annually."

This proposal will also include an amendment to the Superior National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan to reflect this withdrawal. The purpose of the withdrawal request is protection of the natural resources and waters located on NFS lands from the potential adverse environmental impacts arising from exploration and development of fully Federally-owned minerals conducted pursuant to the mineral leasing laws within the Rainy River Watershed that flow into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Mining Protection Area (MPA) in northeastern Minnesota. The USFS acknowledges this proposed request subjects these NFS lands to temporary segregation for up to 2 years from entry under the United States mineral and geothermal leasing laws.

In NIOSH Current Intelligence Bulletin (CIB) 61--A Strategy for Assigning New NIOSH Skin Notations, Appendix E.2, Evaluation of data, pp. 41-42 [http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2009-147/pdfs/2009- 147.pdf] these levels of evidence are defined as the following: ``Data sets classified as sufficient are those that include human and/or animal toxicity studies conducted according to standardized protocols and that provide in-depth descriptions of the exposure conditions and study findings. Data sets classified as limited via the qualitative ranking scheme contain either human and/or animal studies conducted by non-standardized protocols or contain incomplete descriptions of the exposure conditions and study findings. Data sets classified as insufficient include studies that primarily either did not apply standard protocols or did not provide an in-depth description of the exposure conditions or study findings. Data sets that receive the insufficient ranking will not be used as the basis for the NIOSH skin notation.'' NIOSH proposes to clarify the definitions for the sufficient, limited, and insufficient levels of evidence to the following: ``Data sets classified as sufficient are those that include human and/or animal studies conducted using standardized protocols and that provide complete descriptions of the exposure conditions and study findings. Data sets classified as limited are those that include human and/or animal studies conducted using non-standardized protocols or that provide incomplete descriptions of the exposure conditions or study findings. Data sets classified as insufficient are those that include human and/or animal studies conducted using non-standardized protocols and that provide incomplete descriptions of the exposure conditions and study findings. Data sets that receive the insufficient ranking will not be used as the basis for the NIOSH skin notation.'' Evaluation of dose-related effects in studies with limited or insufficient evidence, mechanistic data, and analogous chemical properties may be factored into the classification scheme for determining the level of evidence for identified studies. Data sets that provide insufficient evidence will not be used as the basis for the NIOSH skin notation but, in some cases, may provide information to support or contradict evidence for the skin notation. For data sets with conflicting findings, an overall determination based on the body of evidence will be developed by evaluating data adequacy, reliability and relevance, and assessing each study's quality of evidence. The studies with the best quality and validity to support the notation are identified and cited in the individual Skin Notation Profile documents. NIOSH seeks comments on proposed changes as described above."

AD 2014-08-02 requires modifying the profile of stringer run-outs of both wings, including a high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspection of the fastener holes for defects, and repairs if necessary. Since we issued AD 2014-08-02, further analysis in the context of widespread fatigue damage (WFD) concluded that a shorter compliance time is necessary to meet specified requirements to address WFD. This proposed AD would retain the actions required by AD 2014-08-02 and would revise the compliance times. We are proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products."

This determination, also known as a clean data determination (CDD), is based upon complete, quality-assured, and certified ambient air monitoring data showing that the area has monitored attainment of the 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS based on the 2013-2015 data available in the EPA's Air Quality System database. As a consequence of this determination of attainment, certain Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements that apply to the Imperial County Air Pollution Control District (ICAPCD or ``District'') shall be suspended for so long as the area continues to meet the 2006 24-hour PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. The area remains nonattainment for the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS. The EPA is also approving a revision to California's state implementation plan (SIP) consisting of the 2008 emissions inventory for the Imperial County NA submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB or ``State'') on January 9, 2015. This action is being taken under the CAA. Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, we are proposing approval and soliciting written comment on these actions. If we receive adverse comments on this direct final rule that result in withdrawal of the entire rule or any part(s) of it, we will address those comments when we finalize the proposal. The EPA does not plan to institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting must do so at this time."

This design feature is an electronic flight control system that contains fly-by-wire control laws, including flight envelope protection functions that impose pitch-angle, bank-angle, and high- speed limits during normal operation. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards."

The Council is proposing to approve $768,680 in implementation funding for Palm River. The Council is also proposing to reallocate $87,750 from planning to implementation. The total amount available for implementation of Palm River would be $856,430. These funds would be used for construction of three stormwater ponds, exotic vegetation removal, native planting, monitoring, management of exotic species, and maintenance of the culverts/stormwater ponds along the Palm River at the mouth of McKay Bay. In the Initial FPL, components of the Palm River project were split among two sponsors: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Florida. The EPA portion of the Palm River project was included with a larger set of restoration measures within the FPL activity entitled Tampa Bay National Estuary Program. To enhance administrative efficiency, the Council is proposing to unify the two components of the Palm River project under one sponsor, Florida. The implementation funding proposed above includes monies originally budgeted for implementation of the EPA component ($271,430). To comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other applicable laws, the Council is proposing to adopt an existing Environmental Assessment (EA) and ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of an associated Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 404 permit that has been issued for the project. In so doing, the Council would expedite project implementation, reduce planning costs and potentially increase the ecological benefits of this project."

Consistent with our approval of the Ecology general air quality regulations, we are also proposing to approve revisions to implement the preconstruction permitting regulations for large industrial (major source) facilities in attainment and unclassifiable areas, called the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program. The PSD program for major energy facilities under EFSEC's jurisdiction has historically been operated under a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP), in cooperation with the EPA and Ecology. If finalized, the EPA's proposed approval of the EFSEC PSD program would narrow the FIP to include only those few potential facilities, emission sources, geographic areas, and permits for which EFSEC does not have jurisdiction or authority. The EPA is also proposing to approve EFSEC's visibility protection permitting program which overlaps significantly with the PSD program in most cases."

The FMCSA requests approval to reinstate, without any changes to the ICR titled, ``Financial Responsibility--Motor Carriers, Freight Forwarders, and Brokers,'' which is used to provide registered motor carriers, property brokers, and freight forwarders a means of meeting financial responsibility filing requirements. This ICR requires reinstatement because the previous ICR expired on February 28, 2017, before the ICR renewal request could be submitted to OMB for approval. The ICR sets forth the financial responsibility documentation requirements for motor carriers, freight forwarders, and brokers that arise as a result of the Agency's jurisdictional statutes. The reinstatement of the ICR allows the FMCSA to ensure the public is protected and will be compensated for claims involving bodily injury and property damage, or loss or damage to household goods, respectively, within the limits prescribed by FMCSA. Reinstatement of the ICR enforces the filing of surety bonds or trust fund agreements to help ensure that motor carriers and shippers are protected against non-performance of the broker's or freight forwarder's legal obligations. With reinstatement of the ICR, insurance companies can be held liable for any damages that may occur to the public (up to the limits of the policy), and to supersede any exclusions or limitations which may be contained in the insured motor carrier's or freight forwarder's policy. Additionally, FMCSA can make a determination regarding whether an entity qualifies for the grant of self-insurance authority."

We have determined that supplemental inspections are required for timely detection of fatigue cracking for certain structurally significant items (SSIs). This proposed AD would require revising the maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to add supplemental inspections. This proposed AD would also require inspections to detect cracks in each SSI, and repair of any cracked structure. We are proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products."

The Proposed Action is a regional water supply project intended to provide up to 175,000 acre-feet/year (AFY), with an estimated firm yield of 120,665 AFY, of new water for NTMWD's member cities and direct customers in all or portions of nine counties in northern Texas--Collin, Dallas, Denton, Fannin, Hopkins, Hunt, Kaufman, Rains and Rockwall. Construction of the reservoir and related facilities would result in permanent impacts to approximately 5,874 acres of wetlands and 651,140 linear feet of streams, and 78 acres of open waters. This action requires authorization from the USACE under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). The Section 404 of the CWA permit applicant is the NTMWD. The RDEIS was prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, and the USACE's regulations for NEPA implementation (33 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] parts 230 and 325 (with associated Appendices B and C). The USACE, Tulsa District, Regulatory Office is the lead federal agency responsible for the RDEIS and information contained in the EIS will serve as the basis for a decision whether or not to issue a Section 404 of the CWA permit.

The NRC is proposing to: Eliminate license terms for licenses issued under the authority of Sections 104a or 104c of the AEA, other than for testing facilities; define the license renewal process for licenses issued to testing facilities or under the authority of Section 103 of the AEA; require all NPUF licensees to submit final safety analysis report (FSAR) updates to the NRC every 5 years; and provide an accident dose criterion of 1 rem (0.01 Sievert (Sv)) total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) for NPUFs other than testing facilities.

The proposed rule is necessary to provide for the safety of the participants, participant vessels, and the general public on the navigable waters of the United States during the fireworks displays. This proposed rule would allow the Coast Guard to restrict persons and vessels, except those participating in the event, from entering, transiting through, anchoring in, or remaining within the regulated area unless authorized by the COTP Key West or a designated representative.

On July 1, 2016, ONRR published a final rule, Consolidated Federal Oil and Gas and Federal and Indian Coal Valuation Reform (2017 Valuation Rule). ONRR subsequently stayed the effective date of that rule pending resolution of litigation. As a result of the stay, the regulations in effect prior to January 1, 2017 (``pre-existing regulations'') remain in effect. In a separate notice, ONRR is seeking comments on a proposed rule to repeal the 2017 Valuation Rule to maintain the status quo in which the pre-existing regulations remain in effect while ONRR reconsiders whether changes made by the 2017 Valuation Rule are needed or appropriate."

While the weighting factor has existed for decades, it has never been included in any of the previous ratemaking calculations. We propose to add steps to our rate-setting methodology to adjust hourly rates downwards by an amount equal to the average weighting factor, so that when the weighting factor is applied, the cost to the shippers and the corresponding revenue generated for the pilot associations will adjust to what was originally intended.

Actions evaluated in the master plan consist of assignment of federal land to foreign missions for the purpose of constructing and operating new chancery facilities. DOS has prepared this SDEIS on the alternatives considered for the master plan, consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, regulations developed by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR part 1500), and DOS regulations for implementing NEPA (22 CFR part 161). The master plan is intended to guide the development of a cohesive campus by establishing design and land-use planning principles for the construction of new buildings, roadways, open green space, and utilities, while minimizing environmental impacts. The SDEIS analyzes the potential impacts associated with a no action alternative and an action alternative that could potentially satisfy the purpose and need defined in the SDEIS and master plan. A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was previously circulated publicly in February 2014. Subsequent to the publication of the DEIS, the total acreage of the land available for transfer from the Army to DOS was reduced from 43.5 to 31.7 acres through the National Defense Authorization Act of 2015. Because of the change in the proposed action, DOS has prepared an SDEIS to describe the new preferred alternative, and evaluate any change in potential impacts from the reduction in size of the proposed action. In addition, the DOS is carrying out the Section 106 review process under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, through which it consults with interested parties on the potential effect of the proposed undertaking on identified historic properties."

This proposed rule would revise the listing of events that informs the public of regularly scheduled marine parades, regattas, other organized water events, and fireworks displays that require additional safety measures provided by regulations. Through this rulemaking, the list of recurring marine events requiring special local regulations or safety zones would be updated with revisions, additional events, and removal of events that no longer take place in the Fifth Coast Guard District. When these regulations are enforced, certain restrictions are placed on marine traffic in specified areas. This rulemaking project promotes efficiency by eliminating the need to produce a separate rule for each individual recurring event, and serves to provide notice of the known recurring events requiring a special local regulation or safety zone throughout the year. This proposed rule would also remove regulations that are no longer effective or required. We invite your comments on this rulemaking."

The Agency Preferred Alternative developed by WAPA and the BLM through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process and described in the Final EIS is summarized in this Record of Decision (ROD). Because the BLM and WAPA were joint lead agencies in the preparation of the EIS, each agency will issue its own ROD(s) addressing the overall Project and the specific matters within its jurisdiction and authority. This ROD constitutes WAPA's decision with respect to the alternatives considered in the Final EIS. The U.S. Forest Service (USFS), Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), and Utah Reclamation Mitigation Conservation Commission (URMCC) are cooperating agencies in the proposed Project based on their potential Federal action to issue use permits across lands under their respective management. These agencies also will issue their own decisions regarding their specific agency actions. Additional cooperating agencies include Federal, state, tribal, and local agencies. WAPA has selected the Agency Preferred Alternative identified in the Final EIS as the route for the Project. This decision on the route will enable design and engineering activities to proceed and help inform WAPA's Federal action(s) to consider any received or anticipated loan application permitted under its borrowing authority and/or exercise its options for participation in the Project.

Chapter 35), the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) is forwarding an Information Collection Request (ICR) to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Our ICR describes the information we seek to collect from the public. Review and approval by OIRA ensures that we impose appropriate paperwork burdens. The RRB invites comments on the proposed collection of information to determine (1) the practical utility of the collection; (2) the accuracy of the estimated burden of the collection; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information that is the subject of collection; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of collections on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. Comments to the RRB or OIRA must contain the OMB control number of the ICR. For proper consideration of your comments, it is best if the RRB and OIRA receive them within 30 days of the publication date. Title and purpose of information collection: Continuing Disability Report; OMB 3220-0187. Under Section 2 of the Railroad Retirement Act, an annuity is not payable or is reduced for any month in which the annuitant works for a railroad or earns more than prescribed dollar amounts from either non-railroad employment or self-employment. Certain types of work may indicate an annuitant's recovery from disability. The provisions relating to the reduction or non-payment of an annuity by reason of work, and an annuitant's recovery from disability for work, are prescribed in 20 CFR 220.17-220.20. The RRB conducts continuing disability reviews (CDR) to determine whether an annuitant continues to meet the disability requirements of the law. Provisions relating to when and how often the RRB conducts CDR's are prescribed in 20 CFR 220.186. Form G-254, Continuing Disability Report, is used by the RRB to develop information for a CDR determination, including a determination prompted by a report of work, return to railroad service, allegation of medical improvement, or a routine disability review call-up. Form G- 254a, Continuing Disability Update Report, is used to help identify a disability annuitant whose work activity and/or recent medical history warrants completion of Form G-254 for a more extensive review. Completion is required to retain a benefit. One response is requested of each respondent to Forms G-254 and G-254a. Previous Requests for Comments: The RRB has already published the initial 60-day notice (82 FR 8961 on February 1, 2017) required by 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2). That request elicited no comments."

In the fall of 2014 and spring of 2015, the EPA approved numerous revisions to Ecology's general air quality regulations. However, our approval of the updated Ecology regulations applied only to geographic areas where Ecology, and not a local air agency, had jurisdiction, and statewide, to source categories over which Ecology had sole jurisdiction. Under the Washington Clean Air Act, local clean air agencies may adopt equally stringent or more stringent requirements in lieu of Ecology's general air quality regulations, if they so choose. Therefore, the EPA stated that we would evaluate the general air quality regulations as they applied to local jurisdictions in separate, future actions. This final action approves the submitted SWCAA general air quality regulations to replace or supplement the corresponding Ecology regulations for sources in SWCAA's jurisdiction, including implementation of the minor new source review and nonattainment new source review permitting programs. This action also approves a limited subset of Ecology regulations, for which there are no corresponding SWCAA corollaries, to apply in SWCAA's jurisdiction."

The EPA is finding that all four States have adequate provisions to prohibit in-state emissions activities from significantly contributing to nonattainment, or interfering with the maintenance, of the 1997 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in other states, and that Rhode Island and Vermont have adequate provisions to prohibit in-state emissions activities from significantly contributing to nonattainment, or interfering with maintenance, of the 1997 fine particulate matter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>) and 2006 PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS in other states.
